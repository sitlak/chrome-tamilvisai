Chrome Tamil Visai is currently under development phase and **no download is ready** as of now.

We are currently able to make the Tamil typing functionality successfully in simple UI with plain INPUT/TEXTAREA pages like Facebook website.

We are working on to enable the Tamil typing functionality to complex UI with Richtext input pages like Gmail, Yahoo! mail websites.

Once we successfully achieve the Tamil typing functionality in almost all kind of websites, we will soon be releasing the beta followed by the stable version of Tamil Visai 1.0

So, keep checking the downloads section of this website quite often.

Happy Tamil Typing!!!
